My XMonad configs

Please don't count on anything in here being stable just yet.
I shall try to mark stuff as stable in comments when it is.

If you have questions, good ideas or I forgot the source of some
of the functions (which may have happened, in which case I sincerely
apologise), please feel free to mail me at:
