My XMonad configs

Please don't count on anything in here being stable just yet.
I shall try to mark stuff as stable in comments when it is.

Generally this whole project is lacking in comments, which will
be remedied at some point along the way. I do, however, try to
import only needed functions, where it makes sense, so as to allow
you to find the functions you don't already know in the XMonad
documentation.

If you have questions, good ideas or I forgot the source of some
of the functions (which may have happened, in which case I sincerely
apologise), please feel free to mail me at:
